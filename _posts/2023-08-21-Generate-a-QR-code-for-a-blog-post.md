Say you have a blog and want to generate a QR code that points to a particular post.

There are multiple online QR generators but I like the Manytools version at:

[https://manytools.org/handy/free-online-barcode-generator-tool/

Simply enter your required text and select "QR-Code" as the type.

Always check your generated code.
