Initial notes

First thing is to get Jekyll setup with a theme and something more than Lorem Ipsum. The theme I am using is Plainwhite, available from:

<a href="https://github.com/samarsault/plainwhite-jekyll">https://github.com/samarsault/plainwhite-jekyll</a>

I've got VSCode editing local files and served on localhost:4000. This seems to be working ok for now.

Once the barebones of the site is up and running, the next part will be to publish the site in Azure blob storage

Then, add ADO as a repository for the site and automate changes being pushed out to the site - CI/CD

Then look at domain name and SSL

Then look at IaC to go from nothing to fully deployed in Azure

Other notes:

- Reload page without cache on OSX - CMD/Shift/R

- Jekyll themes come as complete sites

- Served on localhost:4000
