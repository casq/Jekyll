Initial notes

The theme I am using is Plainwhite, available from:

<a href="https://github.com/samarsault/plainwhite-jekyll">https://github.com/samarsault/plainwhite-jekyll</a>

Jekyll itself is tightly coupled to the theme so in order to get it working, fork the repo into your GitHub account or just download it onto your local machine.

To get familiar with Jekyll, I am editing it in VSCode and serving it locally. This isn't a required step as once you have forked the repo you can import the code straight into the Azure DevOps repository.

Once comfortable with hosting Jekyll locally, the next step is to publish the site in Azure blob storage.

Then, add ADO as a repository for the site and automate changes being pushed out to the site - CI/CD

Then look at domain name and SSL

Then look at IaC to go from nothing to fully deployed in Azure

Other notes:

- Reload page without cache on OSX - CMD/Shift/R

- Jekyll themes come as complete sites

- Served on localhost:4000
