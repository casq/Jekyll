Say you have a blog and want to generate a QR code that points to a particular post.

There are multiple online QR generators but I like the Manytools version at:

[https://manytools.org/handy/free-online-barcode-generator-tool/
](https://manytools.org/handy/free-online-barcode-generator-tool/){:target="_blank"}  

Simply enter your required text and select "QR-Code" as the type.

The QR for this post:
    
![](/assets/images/QRCode/QRCode.png){:class="img-responsive"}{:width="20%"}

Always check your generated code.
